# Carbon-Emissions

A web application that helps measure CO2 emitted due to day-to-day individual consumption of fuel, electricity, etc.

In present times, when not everyone is equally interested in contributing their part to the environment, Carbon Counter makes sure that the user keeps their consumption levels on check by carefully calculating the amount of CO2 levels emitted due to the various daily activities that they perform- commuting via their car to reach their workplace, using the kettle to get their morning coffee, using the hairdryer or another electrical appliance, etc. 

Increasing levels of CO2 is, definitely, a growing problem and this is one way wherein people could acknowledge their consumption rates and take efforts to minimize them, hence doing their bit for the environment.
